Funds are shifted between dYdX, AAVE, and Compound automatically as interest rates change between these protocols. \r\n\r\nThe service offered includes major USD tokens such as DAI, USDT, USDC, and TUSD. For example, if a user deposits DAI into yearn.finance, the user will receive yDAI token in return, which is a yield-bearing DAI token. \r\n\r\nLater on, it collaborated with Curve Finance to release a yield-bearing USD tokens pool that includes four y-tokens: yDAI, yUSDT, yUSDC and yTUSD, it is named as yUSD. \r\n\r\nY...",
