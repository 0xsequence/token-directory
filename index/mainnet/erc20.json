It provides a solution to the scaling problems that developers of decentralized applications (dApps) face while using centralized infrastructure and traditional cloud-based databases. \r\n\r\nBluzelle uses reliable ”swarm” technology, in which it stores tiny bits of data in groups of nodes or “swarms” which are distributed across the globe. Since this makes it independent of single data centres, Bluzelle’s scaling ability is limitless. Bluzelle adjusts the number of nodes and their location dynamically, reducing request time and improving overall performance. Bluzelle's swarm technology makes it extremely reliable as it redundantly stores pieces of data across the globe, eliminating a single point of failure. Since there are no data centres, Bluzelle’s resources are provided by network “producers”, who earn funds and pass on the savi...",

It also allows for issuer-specific parameters such as ownership concentration, holding periods, and voting. By issuing a permissioned ERC-20 token (STPT) on the Ethereum blockchain, Standard Tokenization Protocol ensures that: 1) regulatory and issuer-specific compliance requirements included in the smart contract are met at the token level, and 2) changes in the regulatory landscape can be captured and integrated. Standard Tokenization Protocol standard enables the tokenization of any type of asset in a globally compliant manner.",

It is solving the urgent problem of scalability and high fees by implementing a variant of optimistic roll-ups. Most notably, Cartesi is revolutionizing smart contract programming by allowing developers to code with mainstream software stacks instead of Solidity. Noether is Cartesi's side-chain that’s optimized for ephemeral data, providing low-cost data availability to DApps.\r\n\r\nWhat makes Cartesi Unique?\r\n\r\nWhat gives Cartesi a competitive edge is that it allows developers to code their smart contracts and DApps directly with mainstream software components and Linux OS resources. This is a breakthrough for the productivity of existing DApp developers and for the adoption of non-blockchain developers. This is a necessary step to the very future of blockchains and their applications. In addition, key highlights include:\r\n\r\nTransaction scaling: 20-fold+ TPS increase over Ethereum\r\n\r\nComputational sca...",

Inflation happens daily and does not require any action on the side of the FLOW token holder or any other parties. This method of inflation allows for the token to be applied to modern DeFi use cases without diluting the token holders.\r\n\r\nOver a period of 10 years, inflation is reduced and ends with a capped supply of FLOW tokens.\r\n\r\nFLOW does not need to be staked or locked into a contract to receive inflation, therefore it can be applied to the full range of DeFi applications while still achieving its distribution target.",

Inflation is reduced over a 3 year period to continually provide value to help sustain token value.

There can only ever be 10000 ROOT, and the price floor represents the lowest possible price a ROOT token can ever be. With our new ERC-31337 token wrapper, Rootkit is able to unlock the ETH from under the price floor and send it to a vault. This ETH is moved without effecting the market price, or depth of the order book. As the price floor rises through market volume, liquidity locks. Which means more ETH is unlocked from below the floor and sent to the vault. Because there is no tokens available to sell, the floor starts at the price, which is determined by how many ETH are raised in the ETH. Since we can unback the KETH below the floor, all of the ETH used to create the first liquidity can be used twice. This lets us offer our first LP a huge bonus, which is something n...",

TFL has no intention of keeping or selling MIR tokens, and there are no admin keys or special access privileges granted. The intent for this is to be a completely decentralized, community-driven project.\r\n\r\nMirrored assets are blockchain tokens that behave like \"\"mirror\"\" versions of real-world assets by reflecting the exchange prices on-chain. They give traders the price exposure to real assets while enabling fractional ownership, open access and censorship resistance as any other cryptocurrency. Unlike traditional tokens which serve to represent a real, underlying asset, mAssets are purely synthetic and only capture the price movement of the corresponding asset.",

All series covers a specified protocol and have a specified expiry date. During the expiry date, either CLAIM or NOCLAIM will have the full claim to the collaterals. \r\n\r\nFor example, if 100 DAI is used to provide coverage for Compound protocol until an expiry date, it will yield 100 CLAIM and 100 NOCLAIM tokens. On the expiry date, if there is a valid claim event, every CLAIM token will receive 1 DAI while NOCLAIM token will expire worthless. The converse is true if there is no valid claim event. In this case, every NOCLAIM token will receive 1 DAI while CLAIM token will expire worthless.",
